Jeremy Blum is currently the head of electrical engineering at [Shaper](http://shapertools.com), where he is using computer vision to reinvent the way people use handheld power tools. Prior to joining Shaper, Jeremy was a lead electrical architect/engineer for confidential products at [Google [x]](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2013/08/11/whats-next/), including [Google Glass](http://www.google.com/glass).

Jeremy received his Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University. At Cornell, he oversaw the design and creation of several sustainable buildings around the world and domestically through his founding and leadership of [Cornell University Sustainable Design](http://cusd.cornell.edu). He is also responsible for co-founding a first-of-its-kind [entrepreneurial co-working space](http://popright.in) that contributes to the development of dozens of student start-ups every year.
 
Jeremy has designed [prosthetic hands](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/fsr-controlled-prosthetic-hand/), [lighting control algorithms](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/sunn/), [fiber-optic LED lighting systems](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/hybrid-lighting/), [home-automation systems](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2015/10/15/jarvis-wsj/), [3D printers and scanners](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/makerbot/), [self-assembling robots](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/stochastic-modular-assembly/), [wearable computing platforms](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/sudoglove-hardware-controller/), and [learning robots](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/aracna/). His work has been featured in [international conferences](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2013/03/28/techkriti/), [peer-reviewed journals](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2013/10/06/machine-metabolism-ieee-ram/), and in popular media outlets such as [*The Discovery Channel*](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2011/04/15/sudoglove-on-discovery-channel/), [*The Wall Street Journal*](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2015/10/15/jarvis-wsj/), and [*Popular Science Magazine*](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2015/03/21/raincloud-umbrella-minder-v2/).
 
When not building products, Jeremy is teaching. His written and [video tutorials](https://youtube.com/sciguy14) have been utilized by millions of people to learn electrical engineering and embedded software design. His book, [*Exploring Arduino*](http://exploringarduino.com), has been translated into multiple languages and is used as an engineering textbook around the world, including at his Alma Mater, Cornell. Jeremy’s passion is using engineering to improve people’s lives, and giving people the tools they need to do the same.
