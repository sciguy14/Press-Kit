My passion is using engineering to improve people’s lives, and giving people the tools they need to do the same.

Currently, I'm the head of electrical engineering at [Shaper](http://shapertools.com), where we're using computer vision to reinvent the way people use handheld power tools. Prior to joining Shaper, I was a lead electrical architect for confidential products at [Google [x]](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2013/08/11/whats-next/), including [Google Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass).

I received my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering [from Cornell University](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2013/08/10/looking-back/). At Cornell, I co-founded and led [Cornell University Sustainable Design](http://cusd.cornell.edu), I launched a first-of-its-kind [entrepreneurial co-working space](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/popshop/) for students, and I conducted robotics and machine learning research.
 
I have an insatiable passion for building things. I have designed [prosthetic hands](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/fsr-controlled-prosthetic-hand/), [fiber-optic LED lighting systems](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/hybrid-lighting/), [home-automation systems](http://jarvis.jeremyblum.com), [3D printers and scanners](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/makerbot/), [self-assembling robots](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/stochastic-modular-assembly/), [wearable computing platforms](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/sudoglove-hardware-controller/), [learning robots](http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/aracna/), and more. Some of this work has even been featured in [international conferences](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2013/03/28/techkriti/), [peer-reviewed journals](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2013/10/06/machine-metabolism-ieee-ram/), and in popular media outlets such as [*The Discovery Channel*](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2011/04/15/sudoglove-on-discovery-channel/), [*The Wall Street Journal*](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2015/10/15/jarvis-wsj/), and [*Popular Science Magazine*](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2015/03/21/raincloud-umbrella-minder-v2/). *Forbes Magazine* named me to their annual [*30-Under-30*](http://www.forbes.com/profile/jeremy-blum/) list as recognition for my work that has "helped America make things and get stuff done." I'm also the inventor on [several patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Jeremy+Evan+Blum). Whenever possible, I open source my projects so that others can learn from them, and build upon them.
 
When not building products, I love to teach. My written and [video tutorials](https://youtube.com/sciguy14) have been utilized by millions of people to learn electrical engineering and embedded software design. My book, [*Exploring Arduino*](http://exploringarduino.com), has been translated into multiple languages and is used as an engineering textbook around the world, including at my Alma Mater, Cornell.
